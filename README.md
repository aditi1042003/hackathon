Shortage of data in medical applications:
...........................................

In the age of deep learning, data became an important resource to build powerful smart systems but it is observed that the amount of data needed to build  competitive systems lacks the most in medical sector is not adequate enough for successful employment of AI/ML ,which proves to provide a real benefit.

Strict country policies that hamper the free availability of  medical datasets worldwide
.........................................................................................

Countries are  hesitant to share their medical data and it is a huge hindrance to the development of medical science and  research. The lack of availability of authentic data in the real time duration, reduce the chance of curing present ailments. Release of data after years is of no use for medical advancements as good data plays a huge role in present medical technologies. As far as big data technology is concerned, this delayed progress is a little a  high point to concern.
